These tips may help your baby spit up less often:

- **Don’t feed too much at once.**Instead, give them smaller amounts more often.
- **Burp them often.** Burp your baby during and after meals to help them get rid of gas that can add to problems with spitting up.
- **Keep your baby upright for 30 minutes after a feeding.**Gravity helps keep things down.
- **Don’t bounce them or do other active play right after feeding.**Keep your baby calm for about 20 minutes after they eat.
- **Make sure there’s no pressure on their stomach after they eat.** For example, wait at least 30 minutes before you put your baby in their [car seat](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/stay-safe-in-car).
- **Try a different formula.** A few babies are allergic to milk or soy in [formula](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/choosing-a-formula). Your pediatrician can suggest a formula without these ingredients. You can try it for a week or two to see if it cuts down on spit-up.
- **If you [breastfeed](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/nursing-basics), consider a change to your own diet.**Your baby may spit up less if you cut out dairy or other foods.
